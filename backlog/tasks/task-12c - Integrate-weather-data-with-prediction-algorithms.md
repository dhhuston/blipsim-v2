## Description

Clear, focused description of what this task accomplishes in 1-2 sentences.

## Status: ✅ **Complete**

### Implementation Summary
- Weather integration service created (`weatherIntegration.ts`)
- Prediction engine updated to use weather integration
- App component updated for weather-integrated predictions
- Comprehensive weather integration tests (9/9 passing)
- Jest config fixed for ES modules (axios, react-leaflet)
- Automated test scripts: `npm run test:weather`, `npm run test:ci`
- Tests run automatically and do not require manual intervention

### Testing
- All weather integration tests pass
- Test suite is stable and automated
- No manual intervention required for test runs

### Next Steps
- Proceed to `task-12d` (time-based weather data selection)
- Continue integration and feature development

## Overview
Create the integration layer that connects weather data from the weather service to the trajectory prediction algorithms, enabling realistic balloon flight path calculations based on atmospheric conditions.

## Requirements

### Core Integration Features
- **Weather Data Processing**
  - Transform weather API data to algorithm-compatible format
  - Interpolate weather data for specific altitudes and times
  - Handle missing or incomplete weather data gracefully
  - Cache processed weather data for performance

### Algorithm Integration
- **Wind Data Integration**
  - Pass wind speed/direction to `windDrift.ts` algorithm
  - Handle varying wind conditions at different altitudes
  - Integrate wind data with ascent and descent calculations
  - Account for wind forecast uncertainty

- **Atmospheric Data Integration**
  - Integrate temperature data with `ascent.ts` calculations
  - Use pressure data for burst altitude predictions
  - Account for atmospheric density changes
  - Handle humidity effects on balloon performance

### Data Flow Architecture
- **Weather-to-Prediction Pipeline**
  - Input: Launch time, location, balloon specs
  - Process: Fetch and process weather data
  - Output: Enhanced prediction results with weather integration
  - Error handling for weather service failures
  - **Landing site weather queries must use the landing site's timezone, not just launch site timezone**
