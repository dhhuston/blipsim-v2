# Task 12d: Implement Time-Based Weather Data Selection

## Description

Clear, focused description of what this task accomplishes in 1-2 sentences.

## Overview
Implement intelligent weather data selection and timing logic that fetches appropriate weather forecasts based on launch time and flight duration, ensuring predictions use the most relevant atmospheric conditions.

## Requirements

### Core Features
- **Forecast Window Calculation**
  - Calculate flight duration based on balloon specifications
  - Determine required weather forecast window (launch + flight time)
  - Account for trajectory uncertainty in weather window
  - Handle different forecast resolutions (hourly vs 3-hourly)

### Weather Data Selection
- **Temporal Alignment**
  - Select weather data matching launch time
  - Interpolate between forecast timestamps
  - Handle timezone conversions for weather data
  - Account for weather model update cycles

- **Altitude-Specific Data**
  - Fetch atmospheric data for full altitude profile
  - Handle varying data availability at different altitudes
  - Interpolate missing altitude levels
  - Account for balloon flight path through atmosphere

### Data Quality Management
- **Forecast Reliability**
  - Assess forecast quality based on time horizon
  - Indicate uncertainty for different forecast periods
  - Handle model uncertainty and ensemble data
  - Provide fallback options for poor forecasts

### Data Models
```typescript
interface WeatherRequest {
  launchTime: string;              // ISO timestamp
  launchLocation: Location;
  estimatedFlightDuration: number; // minutes
  altitudeRange: {
    min: number;                   // ground level
    max: number;                   // burst altitude + safety margin
  };
  forecastWindow: {
    start: string;                 // ISO timestamp
    end: string;                   // ISO timestamp
    resolution: 'hourly' | '3hourly' | '6hourly';
  };
}

interface WeatherDataSelection {
  requestedPeriod: TimeRange;
  availableData: WeatherConditions[];
  dataQuality: {
    temporal: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    spatial: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    overall: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'fair' | 'poor';
  };
  interpolationRequired: boolean;
  uncertainty: number;             // 0-1 scale
}
```

### Key Functions
- **`calculateWeatherWindow()`** - Determine required forecast period
- **`selectWeatherData()`** - Choose appropriate weather data
- **`interpolateTemporalData()`** - Interpolate between timestamps
- **`assessDataQuality()`** - Evaluate forecast reliability
- **`optimizeDataSelection()`** - Choose best available data

### Weather Model Integration
- **Multiple Forecast Models**
  - Support different weather models (GFS, ECMWF, etc.)
  - Model-specific quality assessment
  - Ensemble forecast handling
  - Model availability windows

- **Update Cycle Management**
  - Track weather model update schedules
  - Request fresh data when available
  - Cache management for updated forecasts
  - Handling forecast delays or failures

## Dependencies
- `task-12a` - Weather API client (for data fetching)
- `task-12c` - Weather-prediction integration (for data usage)
- `task-14d` - Launch time input (for timing data)
- `task-11a`, `task-11b` - Flight algorithms (for duration estimation)

## Integration Points
- Connect to `weatherService.ts` for data fetching
- Integrate with `weatherIntegration.ts` for algorithm feeding
- Work with `LaunchTimeInput.tsx` for timing information
- Support `predictionEngine.ts` with quality-assured data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Accurate flight duration estimation from balloon specs

## ## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when props invalid
- Loading states for async operations
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Fallback UI for missing data

## ## ## Implementation Notes
- Implement in `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Use Material-UI components for consistency
- Include responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Follow existing component patterns

## ## ## Files Created/Modified
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx` - Main component implementation
