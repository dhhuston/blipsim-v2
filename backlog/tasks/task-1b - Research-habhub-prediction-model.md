## Research Findings

### Overview
HabHub (High Altitude Balloon Hub) was a community-driven platform for high altitude balloon tracking and prediction. The platform has evolved and is now integrated into SondeHub, which uses the CUSF (Cambridge University Spaceflight) prediction model.

### Mathematical Approach
- **Evolution to SondeHub**: HabHub's prediction capabilities have been integrated into SondeHub (https://predict.sondehub.org/)
- **CUSF Model Integration**: SondeHub uses the CUSF standalone predictor as its core prediction engine
- **Physics-based approach**: Same mathematical foundation as CUSF model with atmospheric modeling
- **Wind integration**: Uses NOAA GFS wind data for trajectory calculations
- **Monte Carlo simulation**: Incorporates uncertainty modeling for prediction confidence

### Required Input Parameters
- **Launch parameters**: Latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp
- **Balloon specifications**: Burst altitude, ascent rate, drag coefficient
- **Weather data**: NOAA GFS wind forecasts (automatically fetched)
- **Model configuration**: RMS wind error, timestep size

### Accuracy Benchmarks
- **Typical accuracy**: 10-20km from actual landing location (same as CUSF)
- **Performance factors**: Weather data quality, flight duration, wind conditions
- **Uncertainty modeling**: Monte Carlo approach with wind variance
- **Validation**: Tested against actual balloon flights

### Open Source Implementation
- **SondeHub Predictor**: https://predict.sondehub.org/
- **Based on CUSF**: Uses the CUSF standalone predictor (https://github.com/jonsowman/cusf-standalone-predictor)
- **Web interface**: Modern web-based prediction tool
- **Real-time data**: Integrates with live tracking data
- **Community-driven**: Open source and community maintained

### Limitations and Constraints
- **Weather data dependency**: Requires accurate NOAA GFS data
- **Balloon type specificity**: Optimized for latex meteorological balloons
- **Computational requirements**: Real-time weather data fetching
- **Geographic coverage**: Limited to GFS data availability
- **Model assumptions**: Constant ascent rate, terminal velocity descent
- **Platform evolution**: Original HabHub has been superseded by SondeHub

### Integration Opportunities for BLIiPSim v2
- **Algorithm adaptation**: Can leverage the proven CUSF model approach
- **Weather data**: Can use same NOAA GFS data sources as SondeHub
- **Uncertainty modeling**: Monte Carlo approach is valuable for confidence intervals
- **Real-time capabilities**: Web-based architecture suitable for modern web app
- **Open source**: Both CUSF and SondeHub are open source with proper attribution

### Key Differences from CUSF
- **Web interface**: SondeHub provides a modern web interface vs CUSF's command-line tool
- **Real-time integration**: Better integration with live tracking data
- **Community features**: Enhanced community-driven development
- **Mobile support**: Responsive design for mobile devices
