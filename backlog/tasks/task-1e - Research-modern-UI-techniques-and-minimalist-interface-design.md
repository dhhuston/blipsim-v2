## Description

Research modern UI techniques and minimalist interface design principles to enhance the BLIiPSim user experience. Focus on clean, intuitive interfaces that prioritize functionality while maintaining visual appeal.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Research current minimalist design trends and principles 
- [x] Identify key UI/UX patterns for scientific/technical applications 
- [x] Document color schemes and typography best practices 
- [x] Research responsive design techniques for dashboard layouts 
- [x] Identify accessibility considerations for minimalist interfaces 
- [x] Document micro-interactions and subtle animations 
- [x] Research component libraries suitable for React/TypeScript 
- [x] Document performance implications of modern UI techniques 

## Research Areas

### Design Principles
- Minimalist design philosophy and core principles
- White space utilization and visual hierarchy
- Typography and readability in technical interfaces
- Color theory for scientific applications

### Component Patterns
