## Description

Research smooth animation libraries and techniques to enhance the BLIiPSim user experience with fluid, performant animations that improve usability without compromising functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research popular React animation libraries (Framer Motion, React Spring, etc.) 
- [ ] Identify performance implications of different animation approaches 
- [ ] Document best practices for map and data visualization animations 
- [ ] Research micro-interactions and transition patterns 
- [ ] Identify accessibility considerations for animations 
- [ ] Document browser compatibility and fallback strategies 
- [ ] Research animation timing and easing functions 
- [ ] Identify memory usage and performance optimization techniques 

## Research Areas

### Animation Libraries
- Framer Motion: Features, performance, React integration
- React Spring: Physics-based animations, performance
- React Transition Group: Simple transitions
- Lottie: Complex animations and design integration
