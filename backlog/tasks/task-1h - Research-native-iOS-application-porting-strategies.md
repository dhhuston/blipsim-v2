## Description

Research native iOS application porting strategies to understand the best approaches for creating a mobile version of BLIiPSim, considering performance, user experience, and development efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research React Native vs native iOS development approaches
- [ ] Identify cross-platform frameworks (Expo, Capacitor, etc.)
- [ ] Document iOS-specific UI/UX patterns and guidelines
- [ ] Research performance implications of different porting strategies
- [ ] Identify map integration options for iOS
- [ ] Document offline capabilities and data storage strategies
- [ ] Research iOS app store requirements and deployment
- [ ] Identify testing strategies for mobile applications

## Research Areas

### Cross-Platform Frameworks
- React Native: Performance, ecosystem, iOS integration
- Expo: Development experience, limitations, managed vs bare workflow
- Capacitor: Web-to-native bridge, plugin ecosystem
- Flutter: Alternative cross-platform approach
- Native iOS: Pure Swift/SwiftUI development

### Technical Considerations
- Performance comparison between frameworks
- Bundle size and app size optimization
- Memory management and battery usage
- Network handling and offline capabilities
- Background processing and location services

### Map Integration
- MapKit integration for native iOS
- React Native map libraries (react-native-maps)
- WebView-based map solutions
- Custom map implementations
- Offline map capabilities

### iOS-Specific Features
- Touch gestures and haptic feedback
- iOS design patterns (HIG compliance)
- Accessibility features and VoiceOver support
- Background app refresh and location updates
- Push notifications and local notifications

### Development Workflow
- Development environment setup
- Debugging and testing strategies
- CI/CD for mobile applications
- Code sharing between web and mobile
- Version management and updates

### Deployment and Distribution
- iOS App Store requirements and guidelines
- Code signing and provisioning profiles
- Beta testing (TestFlight)
- App review process and common rejections
- Analytics and crash reporting

### Data Management
- Local storage options (Core Data, SQLite, AsyncStorage)
- Offline data synchronization
- Secure data storage and encryption
- Background data processing
- Data migration strategies
