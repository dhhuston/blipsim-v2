## Description

Implement a calculator that takes a target landing location as input and determines the optimal launch location and timing required to achieve that landing site. This accounts for wind patterns, flight duration, and trajectory prediction.

## ## Technical Specifications

### Data Models
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
  requiredProp: string;
  optionalProp?: number;
  onEvent?: (data: any) => void;
}

interface ComponentState {
  // State interface
  isLoading: boolean;
  data: any[];
  error?: string;
}
```

### File Structure
```
components/
├── ComponentName.tsx
├── ComponentName.test.tsx
└── ComponentName.css
```

### Integration Points
- Connect to `{parent component}` for {data flow}
- Integrate with `{service}` for {functionality}
- Update `App.tsx` to include component
- Connect to `{state management}` for data

## ## ## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for component rendering
- Integration tests with mock data
- Performance tests for user interactions
- Error handling tests for invalid props
- Edge case testing (empty data, loading states)
- End-to-end tests with real user interactions

## ## ## Performance Requirements
- Component rendering < {X}ms for typical props
- Memory usage < {X}MB for large datasets
- Smooth interactions ({X}fps)
- Bundle size increase < {X}KB ({dependencies})

## ## ## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when props invalid
- Loading states for async operations
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Fallback UI for missing data

## ## ## Implementation Notes
- Implement in `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Use Material-UI components for consistency
- Include responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Follow existing component patterns

## ## ## Files Created/Modified
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.css` - Component-specific styling
- `app/src/App.tsx` - Integration with main application

## ## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Input field for target landing location (coordinates or address)
- [ ] Algorithm calculates optimal launch location based on wind patterns
- [ ] Algorithm determines optimal launch time for target landing
- [ ] System accounts for seasonal wind patterns and weather conditions
- [ ] Provides multiple launch location options with different confidence levels
- [ ] Shows launch timing windows for optimal landing probability
- [ ] Calculates required flight duration for each launch option
- [ ] Provides confidence intervals for landing location prediction
- [ ] Integrates with historical wind data for improved accuracy
- [ ] Shows alternative launch locations if primary target is unachievable
