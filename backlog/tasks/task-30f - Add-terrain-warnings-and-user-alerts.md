Clear, focused description of what this task accomplishes in 1-2 sentences.

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive terrain warning system that alerts users to challenging terrain in their flight path, difficult landing sites, and potential obstacles. This includes creating user-friendly alerts and recommendations.

## Objectives
- Create terrain warning system
- Implement user alerts for challenging terrain
- Provide terrain-based recommendations
- Create difficulty level indicators
- Implement terrain safety notifications

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Terrain warning system**: Alert users to challenging terrain in flight path
- **Landing site warnings**: Warn about difficult landing sites
- **Obstacle alerts**: Notify users of terrain obstacles
- **Difficulty level indicators**: Show clear difficulty ratings for landing sites
- **Safety recommendations**: Provide recommendations for challenging terrain
- **Alternative route suggestions**: Suggest alternative routes when terrain is challenging

### Technical Requirements
- **Alert system**: Create reusable alert/notification components
- **Warning logic**: Implement logic to determine when warnings are needed
- **User interface**: Design clear and intuitive warning displays
- **Alert persistence**: Store and display persistent warnings
- **Real-time updates**: Update warnings as flight parameters change
- **Accessibility**: Ensure warnings are accessible to all users

### User Experience Requirements
- **Clear messaging**: Use clear, non-technical language for warnings
- **Visual indicators**: Use color coding and icons for different warning levels
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show basic warnings first, details on demand
- **Actionable advice**: Provide specific recommendations for each warning
- **Non-intrusive design**: Warnings should not interfere with normal operation
- **Dismissible alerts**: Allow users to dismiss non-critical warnings

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Terrain warning system implemented and functional
- [ ] Users receive appropriate warnings for challenging terrain
- [ ] Landing site difficulty clearly communicated
- [ ] Obstacle warnings work correctly
- [ ] Recommendations are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Warning system is accessible and user-friendly
- [ ] Performance impact of warning system is minimal

## Dependencies
- Task 30c: Implement terrain analysis algorithms
- Task 30d: Integrate terrain data with prediction engine
- Task 14: Build input forms and parameter controls (for UI integration)

## Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 1-2 weeks
- **Testing**: 3-5 days
- **Integration**: 3-5 days
- **Total**: 2-3 weeks

## Priority
**Medium** - Important for user safety and experience

## ## Technical Specifications

### Data Models
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface
  requiredProp: string;
  optionalProp?: number;
  onEvent?: (data: any) => void;
}

interface ComponentState {
  // State interface
  isLoading: boolean;
  data: any[];
  error?: string;
}
```

### File Structure
```
components/
├── ComponentName.tsx
├── ComponentName.test.tsx
└── ComponentName.css
```

### Integration Points
- Connect to `{parent component}` for {data flow}
- Integrate with `{service}` for {functionality}
- Update `App.tsx` to include component
- Connect to `{state management}` for data

## ## ## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for component rendering
- Integration tests with mock data
- Performance tests for user interactions
- Error handling tests for invalid props
- Edge case testing (empty data, loading states)
- End-to-end tests with real user interactions

## ## ## Performance Requirements
- Component rendering < {X}ms for typical props
- Memory usage < {X}MB for large datasets
- Smooth interactions ({X}fps)
- Bundle size increase < {X}KB ({dependencies})

## ## ## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when props invalid
- Loading states for async operations
- Error boundaries for component failures
- Fallback UI for missing data

## ## ## Implementation Notes
- Implement in `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Use Material-UI components for consistency
- Include responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Follow existing component patterns

## ## ## Files Created/Modified
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.tsx` - Main component implementation
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.test.tsx` - Comprehensive test suite
- `app/src/components/{ComponentName}.css` - Component-specific styling
- `app/src/App.tsx` - Integration with main application

## ## Notes
- Consider implementing warning severity levels (info, warning, danger)
- Test warning system with various terrain scenarios
- Ensure warnings don't create false alarms
- Consider implementing user preferences for warning sensitivity
- Add comprehensive logging for warning system debugging
